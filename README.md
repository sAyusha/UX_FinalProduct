# Artalyst
An online art auction app.

## Brief Description

The Flutter framework is used for the proposed system in order to enable the creation of an app that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. The usage of MongoDB for the backend guarantees quick data acquisition and storage for a smooth auction experience.
